# Image_Classifier_Project

Project Overview
This project involves developing an image classification application using deep learning techniques with PyTorch. The application trains a model on a dataset of flower images and uses the trained model to classify new images. The development process begins with coding in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure the training implementation works, followed by converting the code into command-line applications: train.py and predict.py.​

Installation
To run the code in this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy​
- Pandas​
- Matplotlib​
- Pillow​
- PyTorch​
