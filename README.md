# 🌸 Image Classifier — Oxford Flowers 102 (TensorFlow/Keras)

This repository contains a complete image classification pipeline using **TensorFlow/Keras** on the **Oxford Flowers 102** dataset (loaded via `tensorflow_datasets`).  
It covers data loading and preprocessing, model training (Keras Sequential), evaluation (accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix), and simple inference.
